## Code Overview

### Include necessary libraries and define global variables

The code begins by including the necessary libraries and defining a global variable for the `CTrade` class, which is used for transaction copying.

### Custom function to copy a transaction from source to destination

The `CopyTransaction` function is a custom function that copies a transaction from a source account to a destination account. It retrieves the ticket of the last transaction in the source account and then copies the transaction to the destination.

### Custom function to copy transactions based on the specified direction, source account, and destination account

The `CopyDirection` function is another custom function that copies transactions based on the specified direction, source account, source account, and destination account. It uses the `PositionCopy` function from the `CTrade` class to copy the transactions.

### Custom function to copy a specified quantity of transactions

The `CopyQuantity` function is a custom function that copies a specified quantity of transactions from a source account to a destination account. It uses the `CopyTransaction` function to copy each transaction in a loop.

### Expert initialization function

The `OnInit` function is the expert initialization function. It sets the trade context for the `copyTrade` instance by calling the `SetTradeContext` function.

### Expert deinitialization function

The `OnDeinit` function is the expert deinitialization function. It is called when the expert advisor is being stopped or removed. In this function, the `copyTrade` instance is deinitialized and any allocated resources are released.

### Expert tick function

The `OnTick` function is the expert tick function. This function is called on every tick of the chart. In this function, transactions can be copied based on user input or conditions. Currently, there are no transactions being copied in the example code. You can uncomment the example code provided in the comments and modify it according to your requirements.

### Expert start function

The `OnStart` function is the expert start function. It is called when the expert advisor is started or re-started. In this function, the `OnTick` function is called to run the expert advisor.
